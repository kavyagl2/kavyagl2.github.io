**Meet Kavya, the Data Science Mastermind with a Past Life in HR!**

Mastered the art of numbers (MSc in Data Science) and Management at IIT Ropar & IIM Amritsar 🏆. Before that, aced HR at UPES.  I bridge the gap between humans and data 🤝📈 (and make them both happy 😄


### A Quirky Introduction

By day, Kavya wrangles machines with the best of them as a Machine Learning Engineer at Amikus AI. But her journey to data wizardry wasn't always so linear. In a past life, she charmed the socks off candidates as a Talent Acquisition whiz. Now, she's using her superpowers of data analysis to solve business problems and let's be honest, probably making those same candidates' applications magically appear at the top of the pile (just kidding... maybe).

One thing's for sure, Kavya's got the brains and the experience to tackle any challenge that comes her way. So, if you're looking for someone who can speak both HR lingo and data science jargon, Kavya's your girl!
