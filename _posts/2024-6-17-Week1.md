## Welcome to Kavya Agrawal's GSoC'24 Page
##### Grateful to DBPedia for choosing me to work on an excellent open-source project **Multilingual Data-to-Text Conversion** with Diego, Bruno and Anand!

## Let's get started!

### Community Bonding Period (28-May-2024)
This was essentially the most fantastic day as I got to interact with fellow contributors and all the mentor. We had a discussion on how things are setup at DBPedia along with the other cool projects that contibutors are working on. We also got a chance to introduce ourselves which made me comfortable with my fellow contributors. In the end, we had so many photos together and ended meetup on **HIGH JOSH!**

#### HAPPPPIIIEEE FACES!
