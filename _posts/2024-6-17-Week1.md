## Welcome to Kavya Agrawal's GSoC'24 Page
###### Grateful to DBPedia which chose me to work on an excellent open-source project **Multi-lingual Data-to-Text Conversion**

## Let's get started!

### Community Bonding Period (28-May-2024)
##### This was essentially the most fantastic day as I got to interact with fellow contributors and all the mentor. We had a discussion on how things are setup at DBPedia along with the other cool projects that contibutors are working on. We also got a chance to introduce ourselves which made me comfortable with my fellow contributors. In the end, we had so many photos together and ended meetup on **HIGH JOSH!**
